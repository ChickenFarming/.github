	<p align="left">
Introducing our chicken disease detection app that detects diseases through chicken droppings. With our App, you can now find out the chicken diseases in your own farm just by scanning the photo of the chicken manure.

Our app presents a unique solution by providing an online virtual chicken disease detection service using highly advanced machine learning algorithms. Simply take a photo of your chicken's droppings via a smartphone camera, and our innovative system will perform a thorough analysis to provide an immediate assessment of your chicken's health. You no longer need to worry about knowing what diseases your chickens are infected with. With this app, you can receive personalized feedback on your chicken's health anytime and anywhere.

In addition, our app is equipped with E-commerce and Maps features. The E-commerce feature allows users to purchase chicken equipment and feed to support the needs of chicken farmers. Meanwhile, the Maps feature is designed to help users locate stores that provide chicken equipment and feed.
